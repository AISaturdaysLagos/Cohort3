    "These notes provide a very brief introduction to the relational data and databases.  Chances are, as a data scientist, if you're going to be processing data stored in any more structured form than simple flat files, it's going to be in some kind of database.  And although schemaless/NoSQL/non-relational databases are popular for some applications, in a large number of cases you're going to be dealing with data in a standard relational database (and this format honestly makes sense for the vast majority of use cases that require a database).\n",
    "\n",

Creating and managing such a database, let alone actually coding one, are not topics we'll consider here."

    "## Overview of relational data\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic unit in any relational data is the notion of a \"relation\", but since no one uses that term anymore, just note that this actually is interchangeable with the common definition we have of \"table\" (though a relation has the additional constraints the rows in the table cannot be duplicates).  To make this concerete, let's consider a \"Person\" table for people involved with this class.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<center>**Person**</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "| ID | Last Name | First Name | Role |\n",
    "| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n",
    "| 1 | Kolter | Zico | Instructor |\n",
    "| 2 | Xi | Edgar | TA |\n",
    "| 3 | Lee | Mark | TA |\n",
    "| 4 | Mani | Shouvik | TA |\n",
    "| 5 | Gates | Bill | Student |\n",
    "| 6 | Musk | Elon | Student |\n",
    "\n",
    "This kind of data representation is so familiar to us that it hardly necessitates any explanation, but a few points of terminology in relational database speak are useful.  In our context, rows are called _tuples_ or _records_, and they represent a single instance of this relation; as mentioned above, the entirety of the row must also be unique (i.e., there cannot be two rows that have identical entries in all columns).  This uniqueness requirement can be trivially satisfied by having a unique ID identifier in each tuple, and we'll discuss this more below.  Columns in the relation are called _attributes_, and specify some feature contained in each of the tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiple relations\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, a single table isn't particular interesting as a rich data source; we could have done (and in fact do) store the exact same information in a CSV file.  Where relational data becomes interesting is when we have multiple tables and explicit relationships between them.  For example, considering the case above, the \"Role\" attribute in our Person table is not particularly well defined.  What is the data type of this attribute?  A string? If so, we could enter anything we want here, which would not be ideal for maintaining a large collection of data, say if each student has to remember to type their role exactly as \"Student\" (with capitalization intact, of course).  A better alternative is to create a separate \"Role\" table, that lists the allowable roles for the course:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>**Role**</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "| ID | Name |\n",
    "| :---: | :---: |\n",
    "| 1 | Instructor |\n",
    "| 2 | TA |\n",
    "| 3 | Student |\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this table, we can replace the \"Role\" attribute in our Person table with a \"Role ID\" attribute that points to the ID of the respective role for each person:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>**Person**</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "| ID | Last Name | First Name | Role ID |\n",

    "| 4 | Mani | Shouvik | 2 |\n",
    "| 5 | Gates | Bill | 3 |\n",
    "| 6 | Musk | Elon | 3 |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Primary and foreign keys\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, we haven't really gained _that_ much benfit here, since it's still possible for the \"Role ID\" attribute to contain some number, e.g. 4, that doesn't have a corresponding entry in the Role table.  This brings us to the concepts of _keys_ and _constraints_.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above examples, \"ID\" attribute serves as what is called a _primary key_.  A primary key is a _unique_ identifier for each row in the table.  It is common to have a single column (like we do here as the \"ID\" column) serve as the primary key, but that is not required; the primary key can consist of multiple columns so long as they are unique in every row.  Every relation (table) in the database must have exactly one primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "A _foreign key_ is an attribute that \"points\" to the primary key of another table.  Thus, in the above example, the \"Role ID\" attribute in the Person table is a foreign key, pointing to the primary key of the Role table.  And the _foreign key constraint_ enforces the fact that the foreign key must point to a valid primary key in the relevant table.  Note, of course, that we _could_ have simply had a single-row Role table with the name itself being the primary key, and had a similar foreign key constraint, but using the ID as a primary key is much more typical.\n",
    "\n",
    "The foreign key constraint help enforce consistency of the database, and also forces us to be careful when we delete elements.  For example, if we delete a row from Role, we must also delete all the rows from Person that point to that primary key, or the foreign key constraint would be violated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indexes (not indices)\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the last \"basic\" element we'll consider in a relational database is the notion of an index.  Indexes are created to \"quickly\" look up rows by some of their attributes.  For example, suppose we wanted to find all the people in our Person table with the last name of \"Gates\".  Naively, there would be no way to do this except search over the entire table to see every column that matched this last name.  Instead of doing this, we can build an index on the \"Last Name\" attribute to provide an efficient means for retreiving tuples based upon last name.  To see how this works conceptually, consider a slightly more explicit form of the Person table, where we explicitly denote the location, on disk or in memory, where each tuple occurs (preusming here that each row takes exactly 100 bytes):\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>**Person**</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "| Location | ID | Last Name | First Name | Role ID |\n",
    "| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n",
    "| **0** | 1 | Kolter | Zico | 1 |\n",
    "| **100** | 2 | Xi | Edgar | 2 |\n",
    "| **200** | 3 | Lee | Mark | 2 |\n",
    "| **300** | 4 | Mani | Shouvik | 2 |\n",
    "| **400** | 5 | Gates | Bill | 3 |\n",
    "| **500** | 6 | Musk | Elon | 3 |\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of an index like a table with just the indexed attribute and the location field (location in the original table), but _sorted_ by the indexed attribute.  So for instance, an index on the Last Name attribute would take the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "|Last Name| Location |\n",
    "| :---: | :---: |\n",
    "| Gates | **400** |\n",
    "| Kolter | **0** |\n",
    "| Lee | **200** |\n",
    "| Mani | **300** |\n",
    "| Musk | **500** |\n",
    "| Xi | **100** |\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this list is sorted, we can look up any element in $O(\\log n)$ time, and then find its corresponding location in the original table.  We can also perform things such as range queries, quickly finding all the entries where the last name starts with \"M\" (search for the first one, then sequentially scan until the condition is no longer met).  Internally, indexes are frequently implemented with B-trees, which are a type of search tree that in made to be particularly efficient on disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a final note, the primary key associated with a table will always have an index associated with it, so by default it will also provide a fast way to look up rows in the table.  It is also possible to have indexes over multiple columns (with some ordering), by just sorting over both columns.\n"

    "## Entity relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "The nature of inter-table relationships via primary and foreign keys actually leads to a number of different possible entity relationships (i.e., relationships between a row in one table and a row in another).  Some of the common types are:\n",
    "- One-to-one\n",
    "- One-to-zero/one\n",
    "- One-to-many\n",
    "- Many-to-many\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll cover each of these in turn, though perhaps not in the order you'd imagine.\n",
    "\n",
    "### One-to-many\n",
    "Instead of beginning with the simpler-seeming one-to-one relation, let's begin with the example we have already actually used in the above setting: the one-to-many relationship.  In the above table example, the Role - Person tables had a one-to-many relationship: one role can have many different people associated with it, but each person must have exactly one role.  This relationship is illustrated with the following notation:\n",
    "\n",
    "![One-to-many relationship.](one_to_many.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The one-to-many relationship is represented in the database using the foreign key constraint discussed earlier.  However, it's also important to note a subtle but important difference between the underlying relationship (which is an inherrent relationship between the two type entities that the tables represent), and the way it is actually expressed within the relational database.  This distinction should become more apparent when we discuss many-to-many relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "### One-to-one (and one-to-zero/one)\n",
    "\n",
    "The next relationship we'll conider is that of one-to-one relationships.  As you may expect, this occurs when there exist two tables such that there every entry of the table has exactly one entry in the corresponding table, and vice versa.  Let's consider a simple example, of an corresponding \"Andrew ID\" table that could associated with our Person table\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>**Andrew ID**</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "| Person ID | Andrew ID |\n",
    "| :---: | :---: |\n",
    "| 1 | zkoler |\n",
    "| 2 | esx |\n",
    "| 3 | marklee |\n",
    "| 4 | shouvikm |\n",
    "| 5 | bgates |\n",
    "| 6 | muskleman |\n",
    "\n",
    "In this instance, every person has exactly one Andrew ID, and every Andrew ID is associated with exactly one person. As you might imagine, the relationship is denoted as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "![One-to-one relationship.](one_to_one.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its simplicity, this type of relation is actually not used that much in practice for an obvious reason: if every entry in each table has a corresponding entry in the other, we could simplify the database design by simply combining these into the same table with attributes from both.  I.e., in the case above we could simply add an additional \"Andrew ID\" attribute to the original Person table, and accomplish the same thing as with two tables and the one-to-one relationship, with less complexity to the database.  When you do see one-to-one relationships in databases, it is often because some tables need to be (or simply are in practice) exact mirrors from tables in other system, so a database designer may not want to merge two tables with all corresponding elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is more common in practice is a one-to-zero/one relationship, where one table always has a corresponding entry in the other, but the inverse relationship is optional.  Let's take an example of a \"Grades\" table, that will store grades for the students in our class.  It may look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>**Grades**</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "| Person ID | HW1 Grade | HW2 Grade |\n",
    "| :---: | :---: | :---: |\n",
    "| 5 | 85 | 95 | \n",
    "| 6 | 80 | 60 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Every entry in the grades table must refer to an entry in the Person table, but not every Person has an entry in the grades table, i.e., the Person and Grades entities have one-to-zero/one relationship.  This is because, depending on one's role in the class, it may or may not make sense to have grades: instructors and TAs won't have grades, just students.  Unlike in the pure one-to-one relationship, in this case it does seem reasonable to have two separate tables for the grades and people, because it seems uncecessary for instance to simply include these attributes in the Person table when they aren't actually relevant to for all people.  The one-to-zero/one relationship is denoted like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![One-to-zero/one relationship.](one_to_zero_one.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are actually a lot of these decorations that you'll see if you look at database schema diagrams.  In the case above, the bar denotes that it's entries in that table are required while the circle denotes that the entries are options.  But honestly, for most relationship types I'll need to consult a reference to remember what all the different annotations of the relationship symbols mean, beyond the basic one-to-many notation, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Many-to-many\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll end by discussing the most involved type of relationship, the many-to-many relationship, where each row in a one table can relate to many rows in another, and vice versa.  As an example, let's consider an alternative way to represent student grades than what we considered above.  A problem with the above representation is that, if we have a separate \"Homework\" table (that describes each assignment, for instance, in terms of the total points, release date, due date, etc), then there is no way to capture the fact that the \"HW1 Grade\" attribute in the Grades tably actually pointed to a particular row in the homework table; this would simply have to be implicit knowledge for a user of the database.  But we can actually do something that is a bit more principled than this.  First, let's consider an instantion of the Homework table we just described:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>**Homework**</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "| ID | Name | Points | Release Date | Due Date |\n",
    "| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n",
    "| 1 | HW1 | 100 | 2018-01-24 | 2018-02-07 |\n",
    "| 2 | HW2 | 100 | 2018-02-07 | 2018-02-21 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we'd like to create an additional table that specifies, for each relevant student and each relevant homework, what the student's grade was.  We can do this via an _associative table_, which links together entries in the Person and Homework tables, and additional assigns a score to each relevant pairing.  For example, the same grades as we highlighted in the past example, could be represented by the table\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>**Person Homework**</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "| Person ID | Homework ID | Score | \n",
    "| :---: | :---: | :---: |\n",
    "| 5 | 1 | 85 |\n",
    "| 5 | 2 | 95 |\n",
    "| 6 | 1 | 80 |\n",
    "| 6 | 2 | 60 |\n",
    "\n",
    "This associative table is a bit interesting.  Unlike previous tables (that all have an individual column as their primary key, usually just the ID column), the primary key of this table is actually the (Person ID, Homework ID) combination, each of which are also foreign keys to the other respective table.  Note that (Person ID, Homework ID) needs to be the primary key here, because we need to require that each person/homework combination has only _one_ score in the table, not potentially multiple scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a conceptual level, though, what this tables allows is a many-to-many relationship between the homework and person entities: each person can complete multiple homeworks, and each homework can be completed by multiple people.  We denote this relationship as:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Many-to-many relationship.](many_to_many.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that from a perspective of the tables themselves, it may also seems reasonable to write the relationship via two one-to-many relationships, explicitly encoding the associative table:\n",
    "\n",
    "![An alternative possibility for the many-to-many relationship.](many_to_many2.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "But this is not really the correct relationship from a philosophical sense.  Remember that relationships in this setting are reall relationships between the underlying entities that the database representes, not between the actual tables in the database.  In this case, the \"real\" underlying relationship is a many-to-many relationship between people and homeworks, and the way that it is enabled via an associative table is simply an \"implementation detail.\"  Thus, if our goal is to describe the actual underlying relationships with entities, we should use the many-to-many relationship here, and realize that we are going to use the associate table as a means of implementing this relationship."

    "## Libraries for relational data\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of Python libraries that handle relational data, typically written as interfaces to several differen relational database management systems (software such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, or a variety of others).  [**Note**: one aside is that software like PostreSQL and MySQL is most correctly refered to as a relation database managment system (RDBMS), _not_ a database.  The database is the actual tables and records specifying an actual collection of data.]\n",
    "\n",
    "In this class, though, we'll mainly interact with relational data through two libraries: [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/).  These are especially simple libraries as far as real databases go: Pandas is decidedly _not_ a real relational database system (although it provides functions that mirror some functionality of them), whereas SQLite _is_ a \"real\" RDBMS, but an extremely simple one without the standard client/server architecture of virtually any real production database.  Nonetheless, for many data science problems they will suffice, and so we focus on them here.\n",

    "### Pandas\n",
    "We have already briefly seen Panda when we discussed data collection, and it ends up being one of the most useful Python libraries for data science.  As we mentioned above (but we're going to repeat this fact many times), Pandas is not a relational database library, but instead a \"data frame\" library.  You can think of a data frame as being essentially like a 2D array, except that entires in the data frame can be any type of Python object (and have mixed types within the array), and the rows/columns can have \"labels\" instead of just integer indices like in a standard array.\n",

    "Unlike Pandas, SQLite actually is a full-featured database, but unlike most production databases, it does not use a client/server model.  Databases are instead stored direclty on disk and accessed just via the library.  This has the advantage of being very simple, with no server to configure and run, but for large applications it is typically insufficient: because files are not very good at concurrent access (that is, many different processes/threads cannot simultaneously read and write from a single file), the system is not ideal for very large databases where multiple threads need to be constant readings from and writing to the database.  Note that SQLite _does_ have some limited forms of concurrency in this respect, but nothing sophisticated when compared to larger scale databases.  If you do want to investigate a more \"production strength\" client/server database, I'd highly recommend looking into PostreSQL.\n",
