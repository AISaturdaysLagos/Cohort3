    "A great deal of data that you will encounter as a data scientist fundamentally involves network data, interrelated objects with relationships between them.  To give some very brief examples: social networks deal with people individuals and the friendship relations between them; web data deals with pages and the linking information between them; and spatial data (at a certain level of abstraction, we will deal more with spatial data in a few lectures), deals with objects and distances between them.\n",

    "Before we start, it is worth specifying the difference in our terminology between a \"network\" and a \"graph\", both terms which are used to refer to the types of interelated objects that we will consider.  However, following fairly standard notation, in general \"network\" refers to the interrelation between actual entities _in the real world_, where as \"graph\" refers to the mathematical models for representing vertices and edges (which will often be used to represent networks).  A similar distinction came up previously in relational databases, between the actual entities that the data refered to, and the instantation of those entities in table form.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Directed vs. undirected graphs\n",
    "Graphs can be either _directed_ (the order of the edges matters, and indications some relation _from_ one node _to_ another, or they can be _undirected_, where the existence of an edge between two nodes implies a bidrectional relationship.  We typically draw directed graphs with arrows between the nodes to indicate direction, and undirected graphs without arrows, like so\n",

    "The type of graph that is most appropriate for a given network of course depend on characteristics of that network.  A \"web graph\", where nodes represent pages, and edges represent links, would be best described by a directed graph: an edge from page A to page B represents a the fact that page A contains a link to page B.  This is a directed relationship, because such a link does not imply that page B also links to page A.  Note that in directed graphs we can absolutely have edges in both directions (i.e., if page A links to page B and page B links back to page A), but this needs to be sepcified by two separate edges in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of an _undirected_ graph would be a graph over authors and co-author relationships.  For instance, if we consider the authors of scientific papers as nodes in a graph, edges can represent whether the two authors have written a paper together.  This is an inherently non-directed relationship: if authors A wrote a paper with author B, there necessarily it is also the case that author B also write a paper with author A.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although there will be some difference in algorithms/representations that are needed for directed vs. undirected graphs (the graph library NetworkX, for instance, has two different classes you need to use depending on the type of graph), but most of what we discuss here will apply equally well, potentially with just very minor modifications, to both types of graphs."

    "### Weighted vs. unweigthed graphs\n",
    "Graphs can either be _weighted_ (edges between nodes have some real-valued weight associated with them), or _unweighted_ (all edges are equal).  We typically denote weighted graphs be writing the weight along edges.  For instance, a weighted version of the undirected graph above could be illustrated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "![A weighted (and undirected) graph.](weighted.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "A graph that encoded distance between cities (say for the task of shortest-path planning, a topic that we will discuss shortly), would be best represented as a weighted graph, where the weigtht corresponded to distance between the cities. A simple social network graph, on the other hand, where nodes indicated people and edges indicates friendship, woudl likely be best represented as an unweighted graph, because (at least as far as the social newtork is concerned), friendship is simply a prescence/absence relationship, not a weighted quantity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there will be cases where the \"right\" reperesentation of the graph depends on the ultimate use case.  Consider the co-authorship network we described earlier.  This could be \"naturally\" represented as either an unweighted graph (where the presence of an edge merely signified that two people had a been a co-author on some paper), or a weighted graph (where the weight on an edge corresponds, say to the number of papers two co-authors have written together).  If our goal is to find \"shortest paths\" in coauthor relationships (for instance, the so-called [Erdős number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number) lists someone's distance from Paul Erdős, a famous mathematician known for extensive collaboration, in a co-authorship network), then an undirected graph would be most natural; there would be no real notion of \"weight\" to the edges in terms of the path.  On the other hand, if the goal was to assess some kind of community structure in the coauthorship graph (also a topic we will deal with shortly), then it makes sense that more papers imply some sort of closer relationship, and thus a weighted version of the graph would be more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "One point worth making is that real-valued weight on edges is in some sense a \"special\" feature to edges.  In general, graphs can have multiple properties and data associated with each node and edge; these can be used, for instance, in machine learning algorithms that operate directly on graphs.  However, edge weight is so common, and often can be directly incorporated into graph algorithms such as shortest path algorithms, that it has a special place in distinguishing types of graphs."

It turns out that in many cases, you can get the all-shortest path solution \"for free\" if you compute the worst-case single-path between two nodes (that is, two nodes that are the furthest apart in the graph), so it's common to use these approaches instead of finding paths between just two nodes.\n",

The basic idea is to include maintain a _priority queue_, which we will call $Q$ in the algorithm below, that maintains the shortest distance from the source to each node in the graph.  When we pop a node off the queue (according to the shortest distance), we update the distance of all its neighbors to be the minimum of their current distance or the distance of the popped node plus the distance between the popped node as its neighbor.

Google's actual initial technological advance was not just this algorithm, but a systems-based approach that could actually compute these results on a graph of the entire Web (albeit the web in 1997, which was significantly smaller, but then ago so were computers at that time).

These questions are all impossible to answer \"factually\" in some sense, because they are ultimately subjective.  But the PageRank algorithm is one answer to these questions.  The historical context for the algorithm is that, traditionally, web search worked by trying to match a user's search string with the terms on a page; this works well in many cases, but it also tends to ignore whether or not \"important\" pages are being returned.  Especially for common search terms, a _lot_ of pages will match the terms, and how do we rank between these?  Google's answer was to compute the PageRank-based importance of each page, and sort between matching sites based upon this.\n",

    "\n",
    "The last algorithm we will consider here focuses on another problem in graphs, which has generated increasing interest in recent years, the problem of detecting \"communities\" in graphs.  Let's consider the following (undirected) graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Example graph with clear instances of 'communities'](communities.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly, there are three subgraphs here that seem to form \"communities\", tighly knit subgrounds where most nodes are interconnected (they don't need to be fully connected, a type of subgraph formally called a \"clique\", but they are clique-like in that they are \"almost\" fully connected, by some definition), and which are only connected to other parts of the graph relatively sparsely.  Such communities play a large role in the analysis of social networks (the setting where the name is most appropriate, since these often correspond to actual communities of people), where it is common for small groups to all be friends with each other, and have relatively fewer connections outside the group.  But the use of community detection is also valuable in other types of graphs, for instance finding scientific subfields by looking at communities in paper citation graphs, or even finding biologically related functions by looking at protein interaction networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several different algorithms for finding communities, but one well-known approach is the Girvan-Newman algorithm, which was proposed in 2003.  To be more precise, the algorithm does not immediately produce a breakdown in the graph into communities, but instead a _dendrogram_, a hiearchical decomposition of the graph into related nodes, from which communities can be extracted."
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "The basic approach of the Girvan-Newman algorithm is to _remove_ edges from the graph one at a time, in the order of a property called _edge betweenness_ (more on this in a second).  If the graph is broken into two separate connected components, this becomes a hierarchical decomposition of the original graph.  This process in then repeated on both subgraphs recursively.  We aren't going to describe the algorithm in as much detail as Dijsktra's or the PageRank algorithm, mainly because the approach to actually computing the edge betweenness is somewhat involved, so we instead rely on a higher-level description of the algorithm in conceptual terms, with just hints at its implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The edge betweenness property, which orders how we remove edges, is defined as _the number of shortest paths that pass through an edge, considering all pairs of shortest paths from and to each node in the network_ (in the case that there is more than one shortest path between two nodes, we divide the sum evenly over all the paths).   To illustrate this property, let's consider the following graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Graph for illustrating edge betweenness.](gn.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there are a lot of symmetries in the graph, we can specify all the edge betweenness factors by the following labels (all other betweenness factors are the same for the corresponding symmetric edges).\n",
    "\n",
    "![Edge betweeness numbers.](gn_betweenness.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider some examples.  The edge between nodes 1 and 2 has a betweenness of 1, because there is only one shortest path that spans this edge, the path between these two nodes; every other shortest path in the graph, from 1 to any other node, will instead go through node 3.  And similarly the 1--3 edge has a betweenness of 12, because there are 12 other nodes in the network (including node 3) where the shortest path must pass through this edge.  Now consider the 3--7 edge.  This case looks harder, until you realize that this edge is the only one that connects the two subgraphs with nodes (1,2,3) and (4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14); there are 3 nodes in one of these subgraphs and 11 in the other, so there must be 11 times 3 = 33 total shortest paths that path through this edge.  The same goes for the 7--8 edge: this divides two subgraphs of 7 nodes each, so the edge betweenness is 49.\n",
    "\n",
    "These cases might give the impression that edge betweenness is fairly easy (because for a tree-structured graph, it is just a matter of counting the number of nodes on each side of the edge), but in general graphs it can be a bit more complex; computing it requires computing all pairs of shortest paths in the graph (for example using Dijkstra's algorithm above), and then accumulating the count of each time an edge is passed through.  For this reason, we won't dive into the algorithmic detail, but just show how the overall Girvan-Newman algorithm proceeds on the graph above."

    "![First iteration of Girvan-Newman](gn_1.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "After this, we need to _recompute_ the edge betweeness in each of the subgraphs.  This is an important consideration: in general there is no easy way to \"modify\" betweenness of the modified graph after an edge is removed (unless of course the remove occurs on an entirely separate component), so we need to recompute the betweenness again from scratch.  In our example, at this point the 3--7, 6--7, 8--9, and 8--12 edges will all have the (same) highest betweenness, so we remove them all (it would be fine to only remove one and then proceed sequentially, but we can just as easily remove them all), resulting in the following graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Second iteration of Girvan-Newman](gn_2.svg)\n",

    "This shows the hierarchical breakdown of the graph at all the different levels of the edge removals.  This in fact is the result of the Girvan-Newman algorithm; if we want to actual commit to some returned set of communities, we could cut this dendrogram at a specified level in the hierarchy, or perhaps decent the graphs until we find clusters of some prescribed size.  Regardless, the process itself has managed to break the graph down hierarchically into region that appear more and more \"community-like\" until we eventually just reach the nodes themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a final note, due to the need to compute all pairs of shortest paths (at each iteration of the algorithm), Girvan-Newman is not particularly computationally efficient.  More efficient community detection algorithms, such as those based upon Louvain clustering, are currently a bit more common in the literature, but the Girvan-Newman algorithm is still conceptually a very useful approach."

It is somewhat functional for simple data exploration, but if you want to actually create nice drawings, you are better off using a graph visualization tool like [Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/), for which NetworkX has built-in support.  Here's an example of using Graphviz to visualize a graph.  Note that to do this, you'll need to install the [pygraphviz](https://pygraphviz.github.io/) package with the `conda install pygraphviz` (this will also install Graphviz).  "
